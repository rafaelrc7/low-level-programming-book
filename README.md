# Low-Level Programming
Zhirkov, Igor

This is a repository of my solutions to some of the book exercises as I read
it.

One important details is that I chose to use the AT&T Assembly syntax and GNU
AS as my assembler, while the book examples are in the INtel syntax and it is
recommended by the author to use NASM.
